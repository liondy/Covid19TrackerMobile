<br>
P.s: Notice that during `installation`, sometimes `Google Play Protect` will `blocked` the installation process. This is normal because my application isn't in `Google Play Store` <br>
I ran this project all by myself and there's no special institution or goverment contract, so my app got suspended. <br>
